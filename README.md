# SMT2-Fixes
General fixes for Shin Megami Tensei II.\
I originally started this with the intention of reverting the race names made by A Friendly Irin in their qol patch back to the official localisations, but I will be fixing this game up more as I run into issues.

This patch is based on and includes the original Aeon Genesis translation, the Orden name fixes patch, and A Friendly Irin's QOL patch v0.9. Thanks to them for their work on this game.

## Status
- [x] Race names reverted to official localisation
    - Dwarf -> Jirae
    - Mystic -> Yoma
    - Bird -> Flight
    - Wicked -> Jaki
- [x] Fixed a typo that caused the Deity race to show up as Fiend in menus
- [ ] Correct typos and script errors
- [ ] Touch up original translation
- [ ] Fix sword fusion results screen
- [ ] Fix any other issues I come across
- [ ] Possibly further abbreviate equipment names so what sex they can be equipped to can be seen
- [ ] Update demon names to their official localisations

‚ùå Unfortunately I can't forsee a way to fix demon names extending outside the menu without completely rewriting the text engine, which I ain't doing, or abbreviating the names until they're unrecogniseable.
